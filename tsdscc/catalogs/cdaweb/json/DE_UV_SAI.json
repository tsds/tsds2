Two of the photometers\n#                                     provide visible wavelength images, and the third provides images at\n#                                     vacuum-ultraviolet wavelengths.\n#                                     The three photometers are mounted on the spacecraft such that their\n#                                     fields of view are separated by about 120 degrees in a plane oriented\n#                                     perpendicular to the spin axis.  Each photometer in operation collects\n#                                     one scan line during each spacecraft rotation, with an internal mirror\n#                                     stepping once per rotation to start a new scan line.\n#                                     An auroral image is a nadir-centered two-dimensional pixel array\n#                                     provided by the spacecraft rotation and the photometer's stepping mirror\n#                                     which advances the field of view 0.25 degrees once per rotation in a\n#                                     direction perpendicular to the plane of rotation.  A change in mirror-\n#                                     stepping direction signals the start of a new image.  One, two, or\n#                                     three photometers may be in operation at one time.  The images from all\n#                                     operating photometers are telemetered simultaneously with image repetition\n#                                     rates that typically vary from about 3 to 12 minutes.\n#                                     One of the three imaging photometers is equipped with filters and a\n#                                     photocathode for observations at vacuum-ultraviolet wavelengths, in\n#                                     particular emissions of the Lyman-Birge-Hopfield band of molecular\n#                                     nitrogen at about 140 to 170 nm.  Imaging at these wavelengths allows\n#                                     coverage of the auroral oval in both the dark and sunlit ionospheres.\n#                                     The filter array for the vacuum-ultraviolet imaging photometer also\n#                                     includes filters for atomic hydrogen Lyman alpha at 121.6 nm and oxygen\n#                                     lines at 130.4 and 135.6 nm.\n#                                     The full width of the fields of view of the photometers\n#                                     corresponding to a single pixel is 0.29 degrees.  An image frame\n#                                     consists of all scan lines obtained by mirror steps in one direction\n#                                     which deflect the field of view by 0.25 degrees per rotation.  The\n#                                     angular separation of two consecutive pixels in the direction of\n#                                     spacecraft rotation is about 0.23 degrees.  A full frame has 120\n#                                     scan lines or 30 degrees of width.  For routine processing the\n#                                     angular width along a scan line is 150 pixels, or about 34.5 degrees\n#                                     of length.  The frame width is occasionally adjusted to less than\n#                                     120 scan lines.\n#                                     \n#                                     \n#                                     Reference:\n#                                     \n#                                     Frank, L.

The displayable image\n#                                     counts are in variable 3.\n#                                     Coordinates are calculated for each position of the image count array.\n#                                     These coordinates are in variables 14, 15, and 16.\n#                                     To facilitate viewing of the images, a mapping of pixel value to a\n#                                     recommended color table based on the characteristics of the selected\n#                                     filter will be included with each image.  See the description of variables\n#                                     17, 18, and 19 below.\n#                                     A relative intensity scale is provided by the uncompressed count\n#                                     table of variable 20.  Approximate intensity levels in kiloRayleighs are\n#                                     given in the intensity table of variable 21.\n#                                     Other variables provide orbit and attitude data and information about\n#                                     the selected filter and the mirror stepping direction.\n#                                     \n#                                     \n#                                     Variable descriptions:\n#                                     \n#                                     1,2. Start time\n#                                     The time assigned to an image is the start time of the initial scan\n#                                     line within a resolution of one second.\n#                                     \n#                                     3. Image counts\n#                                     Image pixel counts range from 0 to 255.  They are stored in a two-\n#                                     dimensional byte array of 121 columns by 150 rows.  Each column\n#                                     contains one scan line.  Images will generally not fill all of the\n#                                     121 columns.  When an image is displayed with row 1 at the top and\n#                                     column 1 on the left, the spacecraft spin axis is oriented to the\n#                                     left in the display, and the orbit normal vector is oriented to the\n#                                     right.\n#                                     \n#                                     4. Filter\n#                                     Twelve filters are available for ultra-violet imaging; the filter\n#                                     number, 1-12, is given here.  In addition, the peak wavelength in\n#                                     Angstroms is given for the selected filter.\n#                                     \n#                                     5. Presumed altitude of emissions\n#                                     The presumed altitude of the emissions seen in the image varies\n#                                     with the characteristics of the filter used.\n#                                     \n#                                     6,7. First and last mirror location counters (MLCs)\n#                                     The MLC range is from 28 in column 1 (leftmost) to 148 in column 121\n#                                     (rightmost).  The direction of mirror stepping motion is shown by\n#                                     comparing first and last MLCs.\n#                                     \n#                                     8. Orbit/attitude time\n#                                     Whenever possible, the approximate center time of the image is used\n#                                     for determining the orbit and attitude parameters.  If O/A data is\n#                                     not available for the center time, the closest available O/A time\n#                                     is used.\n#                                     \n#                                     9. Spacecraft position vector, GCI\n#                                     \n#                                     10. Spacecraft velocity vector, GCI\n#                                     \n#                                     11. Spacecraft spin axis unit vector, GCI\n#                                     \n#                                     12. Sun position unit vector, GCI\n#                                     \n#                                     13. Orbit normal unit vector, GCI\n#                                     \n#                                     14. Geographic longitude or right ascension\n#                                     East longitude is given for each image pixel on the Earth at the\n#                                     altitude given in variable 5.  When the pixel altitude is greater\n#                                     than the value of variable 5, the right ascension is given.\n#                                     \n#                                     15. Geographic latitude or declination\n#                                     North latitude is given for each image pixel on the Earth at the\n#                                     altitude given in variable 5.  When the pixel altitude is greater\n#                                     than the value of variable 5, the declination is given.\n#                                     \n#                                     16. Pixel altitude\n#                                     For each image pixel on the Earth, the presumed altitude of the\n#                                     emissions is used.  This is equal to the value of variable 5.  For each\n#                                     pixel off the Earth, the altitude of the line of sight is used.\n#                                     \n#                                     17. Pixel UT\n#                                     This array gives the start time for the collection of each image pixel.\n#                                     \n#                                     18. RGB color table\n#                                     This is the recommended color table to be used with the\n#                                     limits given in variables 19 and 20.\n#                                     \n#                                     19,20. Low and high color mapping limits\n#                                     The low and high color limits are recommended for remapping\n#                                     the color table entries, as follows:\n#                                     For pixel values less than the low limit, use the color\n#                                     at table position 1.\n#                                     For pixel values greater than or equal to the low limit\n#                                     and less than or equal to the high limit, use the color\n#                                     at table position (pix-low)/(high-low) x 255 + 1.\n#                                     For pixel values greater than the high limit, use the color\n#                                     at table position 256.\n#                                     \n#                                     21. Expanded count table\n#                                     The image pixel counts are quasi-logarithmically compressed to the\n#                                     range 0-255.

Two of the photometers\n#                                     provide visible wavelength images, and the third provides images at\n#                                     vacuum-ultraviolet wavelengths.\n#                                     The three photometers are mounted on the spacecraft such that their\n#                                     fields of view are separated by about 120 degrees in a plane oriented\n#                                     perpendicular to the spin axis.  Each photometer in operation collects\n#                                     one scan line during each spacecraft rotation, with an internal mirror\n#                                     stepping once per rotation to start a new scan line.\n#                                     An auroral image is a nadir-centered two-dimensional pixel array\n#                                     provided by the spacecraft rotation and the photometer's stepping mirror\n#                                     which advances the field of view 0.25 degrees once per rotation in a\n#                                     direction perpendicular to the plane of rotation.  A change in mirror-\n#                                     stepping direction signals the start of a new image.  One, two, or\n#                                     three photometers may be in operation at one time.  The images from all\n#                                     operating photometers are telemetered simultaneously with image repetition\n#                                     rates that typically vary from about 3 to 12 minutes.\n#                                     One of the three imaging photometers is equipped with filters and a\n#                                     photocathode for observations at vacuum-ultraviolet wavelengths, in\n#                                     particular emissions of the Lyman-Birge-Hopfield band of molecular\n#                                     nitrogen at about 140 to 170 nm.  Imaging at these wavelengths allows\n#                                     coverage of the auroral oval in both the dark and sunlit ionospheres.\n#                                     The filter array for the vacuum-ultraviolet imaging photometer also\n#                                     includes filters for atomic hydrogen Lyman alpha at 121.6 nm and oxygen\n#                                     lines at 130.4 and 135.6 nm.\n#                                     The full width of the fields of view of the photometers\n#                                     corresponding to a single pixel is 0.29 degrees.  An image frame\n#                                     consists of all scan lines obtained by mirror steps in one direction\n#                                     which deflect the field of view by 0.25 degrees per rotation.  The\n#                                     angular separation of two consecutive pixels in the direction of\n#                                     spacecraft rotation is about 0.23 degrees.  A full frame has 120\n#                                     scan lines or 30 degrees of width.  For routine processing the\n#                                     angular width along a scan line is 150 pixels, or about 34.5 degrees\n#                                     of length.  The frame width is occasionally adjusted to less than\n#                                     120 scan lines.\n#                                     \n#                                     \n#                                     Reference:\n#                                     \n#                                     Frank, L.

Start time\n#                                     The time assigned to an image is the start time of the initial scan\n#                                     line within a resolution of one second.\n#                                     \n#                                     3. Image counts\n#                                     Image pixel counts range from 0 to 255.  They are stored in a two-\n#                                     dimensional byte array of 121 columns by 150 rows.  Each column\n#                                     contains one scan line.  Images will generally not fill all of the\n#                                     121 columns.  When an image is displayed with row 1 at the top and\n#                                     column 1 on the left, the spacecraft spin axis is oriented to the\n#                                     left in the display, and the orbit normal vector is oriented to the\n#                                     right.\n#                                     \n#                                     4. Filter\n#                                     Twelve filters are available for ultra-violet imaging; the filter\n#                                     number, 1-12, is given here.  In addition, the peak wavelength in\n#                                     Angstroms is given for the selected filter.\n#                                     \n#                                     5. Presumed altitude of emissions\n#                                     The presumed altitude of the emissions seen in the image varies\n#                                     with the characteristics of the filter used.\n#                                     \n#                                     6,7. First and last mirror location counters (MLCs)\n#                                     The MLC range is from 28 in column 1 (leftmost) to 148 in column 121\n#                                     (rightmost).  The direction of mirror stepping motion is shown by\n#                                     comparing first and last MLCs.\n#                                     \n#                                     8. Orbit/attitude time\n#                                     Whenever possible, the approximate center time of the image is used\n#                                     for determining the orbit and attitude parameters.  If O/A data is\n#                                     not available for the center time, the closest available O/A time\n#                                     is used.\n#                                     \n#                                     9.

Geographic longitude or right ascension\n#                                     East longitude is given for each image pixel on the Earth at the\n#                                     altitude given in variable 5.  When the pixel altitude is greater\n#                                     than the value of variable 5, the right ascension is given.\n#                                     \n#                                     15. Geographic latitude or declination\n#                                     North latitude is given for each image pixel on the Earth at the\n#                                     altitude given in variable 5.  When the pixel altitude is greater\n#                                     than the value of variable 5, the declination is given.\n#                                     \n#                                     16. Pixel altitude\n#                                     For each image pixel on the Earth, the presumed altitude of the\n#                                     emissions is used.

Two of the photometers\n#                                     provide visible wavelength images, and the third provides images at\n#                                     vacuum-ultraviolet wavelengths.\n#                                     The three photometers are mounted on the spacecraft such that their\n#                                     fields of view are separated by about 120 degrees in a plane oriented\n#                                     perpendicular to the spin axis.  Each photometer in operation collects\n#                                     one scan line during each spacecraft rotation, with an internal mirror\n#                                     stepping once per rotation to start a new scan line.\n#                                     An auroral image is a nadir-centered two-dimensional pixel array\n#                                     provided by the spacecraft rotation and the photometer's stepping mirror\n#                                     which advances the field of view 0.25 degrees once per rotation in a\n#                                     direction perpendicular to the plane of rotation.  A change in mirror-\n#                                     stepping direction signals the start of a new image.  One, two, or\n#                                     three photometers may be in operation at one time.  The images from all\n#                                     operating photometers are telemetered simultaneously with image repetition\n#                                     rates that typically vary from about 3 to 12 minutes.\n#                                     One of the three imaging photometers is equipped with filters and a\n#                                     photocathode for observations at vacuum-ultraviolet wavelengths, in\n#                                     particular emissions of the Lyman-Birge-Hopfield band of molecular\n#                                     nitrogen at about 140 to 170 nm.  Imaging at these wavelengths allows\n#                                     coverage of the auroral oval in both the dark and sunlit ionospheres.\n#                                     The filter array for the vacuum-ultraviolet imaging photometer also\n#                                     includes filters for atomic hydrogen Lyman alpha at 121.6 nm and oxygen\n#                                     lines at 130.4 and 135.6 nm.\n#                                     The full width of the fields of view of the photometers\n#                                     corresponding to a single pixel is 0.29 degrees.  An image frame\n#                                     consists of all scan lines obtained by mirror steps in one direction\n#                                     which deflect the field of view by 0.25 degrees per rotation.  The\n#                                     angular separation of two consecutive pixels in the direction of\n#                                     spacecraft rotation is about 0.23 degrees.  A full frame has 120\n#                                     scan lines or 30 degrees of width.  For routine processing the\n#                                     angular width along a scan line is 150 pixels, or about 34.5 degrees\n#                                     of length.  The frame width is occasionally adjusted to less than\n#                                     120 scan lines.\n#                                     \n#                                     \n#                                     Reference:\n#                                     \n#                                     Frank, L.

Start time\n#                                     The time assigned to an image is the start time of the initial scan\n#                                     line within a resolution of one second.\n#                                     \n#                                     3. Image counts\n#                                     Image pixel counts range from 0 to 255.  They are stored in a two-\n#                                     dimensional byte array of 121 columns by 150 rows.  Each column\n#                                     contains one scan line.  Images will generally not fill all of the\n#                                     121 columns.  When an image is displayed with row 1 at the top and\n#                                     column 1 on the left, the spacecraft spin axis is oriented to the\n#                                     left in the display, and the orbit normal vector is oriented to the\n#                                     right.\n#                                     \n#                                     4.

In addition, the peak wavelength in\n#                                     Angstroms is given for the selected filter.\n#                                     \n#                                     5.

The direction of mirror stepping motion is shown by\n#                                     comparing first and last MLCs.\n#                                     \n#                                     8. Orbit/attitude time\n#                                     Whenever possible, the approximate center time of the image is used\n#                                     for determining the orbit and attitude parameters.

Two of the photometers\n#                                     provide visible wavelength images, and the third provides images at\n#                                     vacuum-ultraviolet wavelengths.\n#                                     The three photometers are mounted on the spacecraft such that their\n#                                     fields of view are separated by about 120 degrees in a plane oriented\n#                                     perpendicular to the spin axis.  Each photometer in operation collects\n#                                     one scan line during each spacecraft rotation, with an internal mirror\n#                                     stepping once per rotation to start a new scan line.\n#                                     An auroral image is a nadir-centered two-dimensional pixel array\n#                                     provided by the spacecraft rotation and the photometer's stepping mirror\n#                                     which advances the field of view 0.25 degrees once per rotation in a\n#                                     direction perpendicular to the plane of rotation.  A change in mirror-\n#                                     stepping direction signals the start of a new image.  One, two, or\n#                                     three photometers may be in operation at one time.  The images from all\n#                                     operating photometers are telemetered simultaneously with image repetition\n#                                     rates that typically vary from about 3 to 12 minutes.\n#                                     One of the three imaging photometers is equipped with filters and a\n#                                     photocathode for observations at vacuum-ultraviolet wavelengths, in\n#                                     particular emissions of the Lyman-Birge-Hopfield band of molecular\n#                                     nitrogen at about 140 to 170 nm.  Imaging at these wavelengths allows\n#                                     coverage of the auroral oval in both the dark and sunlit ionospheres.\n#                                     The filter array for the vacuum-ultraviolet imaging photometer also\n#                                     includes filters for atomic hydrogen Lyman alpha at 121.6 nm and oxygen\n#                                     lines at 130.4 and 135.6 nm.\n#                                     The full width of the fields of view of the photometers\n#                                     corresponding to a single pixel is 0.29 degrees.  An image frame\n#                                     consists of all scan lines obtained by mirror steps in one direction\n#                                     which deflect the field of view by 0.25 degrees per rotation.  The\n#                                     angular separation of two consecutive pixels in the direction of\n#                                     spacecraft rotation is about 0.23 degrees.  A full frame has 120\n#                                     scan lines or 30 degrees of width.  For routine processing the\n#                                     angular width along a scan line is 150 pixels, or about 34.5 degrees\n#                                     of length.  The frame width is occasionally adjusted to less than\n#                                     120 scan lines.\n#                                     \n#                                     \n#                                     Reference:\n#                                     \n#                                     Frank, L.

Start time\n#                                     The time assigned to an image is the start time of the initial scan\n#                                     line within a resolution of one second.\n#                                     \n#                                     3. Image counts\n#                                     Image pixel counts range from 0 to 255.  They are stored in a two-\n#                                     dimensional byte array of 121 columns by 150 rows.  Each column\n#                                     contains one scan line.

Orbit/attitude time\n#                                     Whenever possible, the approximate center time of the image is used\n#                                     for determining the orbit and attitude parameters.  If O/A data is\n#                                     not available for the center time, the closest available O/A time\n#                                     is used.\n#                                     \n#                                     9.

Two of the photometers\n#                                     provide visible wavelength images, and the third provides images at\n#                                     vacuum-ultraviolet wavelengths.\n#                                     The three photometers are mounted on the spacecraft such that their\n#                                     fields of view are separated by about 120 degrees in a plane oriented\n#                                     perpendicular to the spin axis.  Each photometer in operation collects\n#                                     one scan line during each spacecraft rotation, with an internal mirror\n#                                     stepping once per rotation to start a new scan line.\n#                                     An auroral image is a nadir-centered two-dimensional pixel array\n#                                     provided by the spacecraft rotation and the photometer's stepping mirror\n#                                     which advances the field of view 0.25 degrees once per rotation in a\n#                                     direction perpendicular to the plane of rotation.  A change in mirror-\n#                                     stepping direction signals the start of a new image.  One, two, or\n#                                     three photometers may be in operation at one time.  The images from all\n#                                     operating photometers are telemetered simultaneously with image repetition\n#                                     rates that typically vary from about 3 to 12 minutes.\n#                                     One of the three imaging photometers is equipped with filters and a\n#                                     photocathode for observations at vacuum-ultraviolet wavelengths, in\n#                                     particular emissions of the Lyman-Birge-Hopfield band of molecular\n#                                     nitrogen at about 140 to 170 nm.

An image frame\n#                                     consists of all scan lines obtained by mirror steps in one direction\n#                                     which deflect the field of view by 0.25 degrees per rotation.

A full frame has 120\n#                                     scan lines or 30 degrees of width.  For routine processing the\n#                                     angular width along a scan line is 150 pixels, or about 34.5 degrees\n#                                     of length.

See the description of variables\n#                                     17, 18, and 19 below.\n#                                     A relative intensity scale is provided by the uncompressed count\n#                                     table of variable 20.  Approximate intensity levels in kiloRayleighs are\n#                                     given in the intensity table of variable 21.\n#                                     Other variables provide orbit and attitude data and information about\n#                                     the selected filter and the mirror stepping direction.\n#                                     \n#                                     \n#                                     Variable descriptions:\n#                                     \n#                                     1,2. Start time\n#                                     The time assigned to an image is the start time of the initial scan\n#                                     line within a resolution of one second.\n#                                     \n#                                     3. Image counts\n#                                     Image pixel counts range from 0 to 255.  They are stored in a two-\n#                                     dimensional byte array of 121 columns by 150 rows.  Each column\n#                                     contains one scan line.  Images will generally not fill all of the\n#                                     121 columns.  When an image is displayed with row 1 at the top and\n#                                     column 1 on the left, the spacecraft spin axis is oriented to the\n#                                     left in the display, and the orbit normal vector is oriented to the\n#                                     right.\n#                                     \n#                                     4. Filter\n#                                     Twelve filters are available for ultra-violet imaging; the filter\n#                                     number, 1-12, is given here.  In addition, the peak wavelength in\n#                                     Angstroms is given for the selected filter.\n#                                     \n#                                     5. Presumed altitude of emissions\n#                                     The presumed altitude of the emissions seen in the image varies\n#                                     with the characteristics of the filter used.\n#                                     \n#                                     6,7. First and last mirror location counters (MLCs)\n#                                     The MLC range is from 28 in column 1 (leftmost) to 148 in column 121\n#                                     (rightmost).  The direction of mirror stepping motion is shown by\n#                                     comparing first and last MLCs.\n#                                     \n#                                     8. Orbit/attitude time\n#                                     Whenever possible, the approximate center time of the image is used\n#                                     for determining the orbit and attitude parameters.  If O/A data is\n#                                     not available for the center time, the closest available O/A time\n#                                     is used.\n#                                     \n#                                     9. Spacecraft position vector, GCI\n#                                     \n#                                     10. Spacecraft velocity vector, GCI\n#                                     \n#                                     11. Spacecraft spin axis unit vector, GCI\n#                                     \n#                                     12. Sun position unit vector, GCI\n#                                     \n#                                     13. Orbit normal unit vector, GCI\n#                                     \n#                                     14. Geographic longitude or right ascension\n#                                     East longitude is given for each image pixel on the Earth at the\n#                                     altitude given in variable 5.  When the pixel altitude is greater\n#                                     than the value of variable 5, the right ascension is given.\n#                                     \n#                                     15. Geographic latitude or declination\n#                                     North latitude is given for each image pixel on the Earth at the\n#                                     altitude given in variable 5.  When the pixel altitude is greater\n#                                     than the value of variable 5, the declination is given.\n#                                     \n#                                     16. Pixel altitude\n#                                     For each image pixel on the Earth, the presumed altitude of the\n#                                     emissions is used.  This is equal to the value of variable 5.  For each\n#                                     pixel off the Earth, the altitude of the line of sight is used.\n#                                     \n#                                     17. Pixel UT\n#                                     This array gives the start time for the collection of each image pixel.\n#                                     \n#                                     18. RGB color table\n#                                     This is the recommended color table to be used with the\n#                                     limits given in variables 19 and 20.\n#                                     \n#                                     19,20. Low and high color mapping limits\n#                                     The low and high color limits are recommended for remapping\n#                                     the color table entries, as follows:\n#                                     For pixel values less than the low limit, use the color\n#                                     at table position 1.\n#                                     For pixel values greater than or equal to the low limit\n#                                     and less than or equal to the high limit, use the color\n#                                     at table position (pix-low)/(high-low) x 255 + 1.\n#                                     For pixel values greater than the high limit, use the color\n#                                     at table position 256.\n#                                     \n#                                     21.
