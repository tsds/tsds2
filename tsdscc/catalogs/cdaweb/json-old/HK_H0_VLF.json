This pulse was to stimulate                     \n#                                      local plasma resonances, such as plasma oscillation, from which the electron                          \n#                                      density could be determined. A pulse of +10 volts was applied to one antenna                          \n#                                      element and a -10 volt pulse was applied to the opposite antenna element. The                         \n#                                      pulser was switched on by command. The pulser was on when the experiment was                          \n#                                      in VLF45 mode and off when the experiment was in the VLF10 mode. The pulser                           \n#                                      voltage was coupled to the antenna through a 220 pf capacitor which would have                        \n#                                      allowed some meaningful data to be obtained from the experiment even if the                           \n#                                      pulser output were to short to ground. The pulse was applied at the end of                            \n#                                      the impedance measurement frame.                                                                      \n#     MODS                            CDF created Jan 1999 by Mona Kessel\n#                                     modified Aug 1999 by Mona Kessel, Carolyn Ng\n#                                     modified Oct 1999 by Mona Kessel\n#                                     modified Nov 1999 by Mona Kessel, final for archiving\n#     ADID_REF                        NSSD0110\n#     LOGICAL_FILE_ID                 hk_h0_vlf_00000000_v01\n#     PI_NAME                         D.
