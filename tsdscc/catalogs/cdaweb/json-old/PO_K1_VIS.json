Two of these\n#                                     cameras share primary and some secondary optics and are designed to\n#                                     provide images of the nighttime auroral oval at visible wavelengths.\n#                                     A third camera is used to monitor the directions of the fields-of-view\n#                                     of the auroral cameras with respect to the sunlit Earth and return\n#                                     global images of the auroral oval at ultraviolet wavelengths.  The\n#                                     VIS instrumentation produces an auroral image of 256 x 256 pixels\n#                                     approximately every 24 seconds dependent on the integration time and\n#                                     filter selected.  The fields-of-view of the two nighttime auroral\n#                                     cameras are 5.6 x 6.3 degrees and 2.8 x 3.3 degrees for the low and\n#                                     medium resolution cameras, respectively.

Two of these\n#                                     cameras share primary and some secondary optics and are designed to\n#                                     provide images of the nighttime auroral oval at visible wavelengths.\n#                                     A third camera is used to monitor the directions of the fields-of-view\n#                                     of the auroral cameras with respect to the sunlit Earth and return\n#                                     global images of the auroral oval at ultraviolet wavelengths.

Two of these\n#                                     cameras share primary and some secondary optics and are designed to\n#                                     provide images of the nighttime auroral oval at visible wavelengths.\n#                                     A third camera is used to monitor the directions of the fields-of-view\n#                                     of the auroral cameras with respect to the sunlit Earth and return\n#                                     global images of the auroral oval at ultraviolet wavelengths.  The\n#                                     VIS instrumentation produces an auroral image of 256 x 256 pixels\n#                                     approximately every 24 seconds dependent on the integration time and\n#                                     filter selected.  The fields-of-view of the two nighttime auroral\n#                                     cameras are 5.6 x 6.3 degrees and 2.8 x 3.3 degrees for the low and\n#                                     medium resolution cameras, respectively.  One or more Earth camera\n#                                     images of 256 x 256 pixels are produced every five minutes, depending\n#                                     on the commanded mode.  The field-of-view of the Earth camera is\n#                                     approximately 20 x 20 degrees.\n#                                     \n#                                     Reference:\n#                                     Frank, L.

Two of these\n#                                     cameras share primary and some secondary optics and are designed to\n#                                     provide images of the nighttime auroral oval at visible wavelengths.\n#                                     A third camera is used to monitor the directions of the fields-of-view\n#                                     of the auroral cameras with respect to the sunlit Earth and return\n#                                     global images of the auroral oval at ultraviolet wavelengths.

Two of these\n#                                     cameras share primary and some secondary optics and are designed to\n#                                     provide images of the nighttime auroral oval at visible wavelengths.\n#                                     A third camera is used to monitor the directions of the fields-of-view\n#                                     of the auroral cameras with respect to the sunlit Earth and return\n#                                     global images of the auroral oval at ultraviolet wavelengths.

The fields-of-view of the two nighttime auroral\n#                                     cameras are 5.6 x 6.3 degrees and 2.8 x 3.3 degrees for the low and\n#                                     medium resolution cameras, respectively.

Two of these\n#                                     cameras share primary and some secondary optics and are designed to\n#                                     provide images of the nighttime auroral oval at visible wavelengths.\n#                                     A third camera is used to monitor the directions of the fields-of-view\n#                                     of the auroral cameras with respect to the sunlit Earth and return\n#                                     global images of the auroral oval at ultraviolet wavelengths.

Two of these\n#                                     cameras share primary and some secondary optics and are designed to\n#                                     provide images of the nighttime auroral oval at visible wavelengths.\n#                                     A third camera is used to monitor the directions of the fields-of-view\n#                                     of the auroral cameras with respect to the sunlit Earth and return\n#                                     global images of the auroral oval at ultraviolet wavelengths.

Two of these\n#                                     cameras share primary and some secondary optics and are designed to\n#                                     provide images of the nighttime auroral oval at visible wavelengths.\n#                                     A third camera is used to monitor the directions of the fields-of-view\n#                                     of the auroral cameras with respect to the sunlit Earth and return\n#                                     global images of the auroral oval at ultraviolet wavelengths.

Two of these\n#                                     cameras share primary and some secondary optics and are designed to\n#                                     provide images of the nighttime auroral oval at visible wavelengths.\n#                                     A third camera is used to monitor the directions of the fields-of-view\n#                                     of the auroral cameras with respect to the sunlit Earth and return\n#                                     global images of the auroral oval at ultraviolet wavelengths.

When the display orientation conventions in the variable 3\n#                                     description are applied, the low resolution camera image is rotated so\n#                                     that both Earth camera and low resolution camera images are displayed\n#                                     with Y axis pointing up and Z axis pointing toward the right.\n#                                     \n#                                     To obtain the coordinates of the observed position of a pixel,\n#                                     calculate the intersection of the line-of-sight with the surface\n#                                     of an oblately spheroidal Earth at the altitude given as\n#                                     variable 7.

Two of these\n#                                     cameras share primary and some secondary optics and are designed to\n#                                     provide images of the nighttime auroral oval at visible wavelengths.\n#                                     A third camera is used to monitor the directions of the fields-of-view\n#                                     of the auroral cameras with respect to the sunlit Earth and return\n#                                     global images of the auroral oval at ultraviolet wavelengths.

Two of these\n#                                     cameras share primary and some secondary optics and are designed to\n#                                     provide images of the nighttime auroral oval at visible wavelengths.\n#                                     A third camera is used to monitor the directions of the fields-of-view\n#                                     of the auroral cameras with respect to the sunlit Earth and return\n#                                     global images of the auroral oval at ultraviolet wavelengths.

Post gap flag\n#                                     The post gap flag has these possible values:\n#                                     0 - no gap occurred immediately prior to this record,\n#                                     1 - the gap occurred because the instrument was not in\n#                                     a mode that allowed for the production of images for the\n#                                     selected sensor,\n#                                     2 - the gap occurred because level zero data were missing,\n#                                     3 - the gap occurred because level zero data were too\n#                                     noisy to extract images.\n#                                     \n#                                     24. Expanded count table\n#                                     The image pixel counts are quasi-logarithmically compressed to the\n#                                     range 0-255.  This table gives the average of the uncompressed range\n#                                     for each compressed count value.  Table entries 1-256 correspond to\n#                                     compressed counts 0-255 respectively.\n#                                     \n#                                     25. Intensity table\n#                                     Approximate intensity levels in kiloRayleighs are given for each\n#                                     compressed count value.  Table entries 1-256 correspond to compressed\n#                                     counts 0-255 respectively.
