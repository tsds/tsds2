Polar angles are measured relative to the spin axis\n#                                     (+Z), and azimuthal angles are measured around the z-axis, with zero along\n#                                     the +X direction. The moments are computed after the fluxes are\n#                                     corrected for background and s/c potential. Algorithms for these corrections\n#                                     are relatively unsophisticated, so the moments are suspect during times of\n#                                     high background and/or high spacecraft potential. Because the determined\n#                                     spacecraft potential is not very precise, the magnitude of the low-energy\n#                                     ion flow velocity is probably not accurate, but the flow direction is well determined.                 \n#     ADID_REF                        NSSD0110\n#     LOGICAL_FILE_ID                 isee1_h2_fpe_00000000_v01\n#     LOGICAL_SOURCE                  isee1_h2_fpe\n#     LOGICAL_SOURCE_DESCRIPTION      ISEE1_H2_FPE / Solar Wind 24-sec Ion Moments\n#     PI_NAME                         S.
