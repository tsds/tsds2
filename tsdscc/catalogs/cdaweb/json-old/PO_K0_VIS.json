Two of these\n#                                     cameras share primary and some secondary optics and are designed to\n#                                     provide images of the nighttime auroral oval at visible wavelengths.\n#                                     A third camera is used to monitor the directions of the fields-of-view\n#                                     of the auroral cameras with respect to the sunlit Earth and return\n#                                     global images of the auroral oval at ultraviolet wavelengths.  The\n#                                     VIS instrumentation produces an auroral image of 256 x 256 pixels\n#                                     approximately every 24 seconds dependent on the integration time and\n#                                     filter selected.  The fields-of-view of the two nighttime auroral\n#                                     cameras are 5.6 x 6.3 degrees and 2.8 x 3.3 degrees for the low and\n#                                     medium resolution cameras, respectively.  One or more Earth camera\n#                                     images of 256 x 256 pixels are produced every five minutes, depending\n#                                     on the commanded mode.  The field-of-view of the Earth camera is\n#                                     approximately 20 x 20 degrees.\n#                                     \n#                                     Reference:\n#                                     Frank, L.

When the display orientation conventions in the variable 3\n#                                     description are applied, the low resolution camera image is rotated so\n#                                     that both Earth camera and low resolution camera images are displayed\n#                                     with Y axis pointing up and Z axis pointing toward the right.\n#                                     \n#                                     To obtain the coordinates of the observed position of a pixel,\n#                                     calculate the intersection of the line-of-sight with the surface\n#                                     of an oblately spheroidal Earth at the altitude given as\n#                                     variable 7.

Image counts\n#                                     Image pixel counts range from 0 to 255.  They are stored in a two-\n#                                     dimensional 256 x 256 byte array.  Images from the Earth camera\n#                                     (sensor 0) are conventionally displayed with row 1 at the top, row 256\n#                                     at the bottom, column 1 on the left, and column 256 on the right.  The\n#                                     conventional image display for the low resolution camera (sensor 1) is\n#                                     rotated 180 degrees so that the row 1-column 1 pixel is at the lower\n#                                     right corner and the row 256-column 256 pixel is at the upper left\n#                                     corner.  When displayed in this manner, the spacecraft spin axis is\n#                                     oriented to the right in the display, the X component is defined as\n#                                     the center of the image look direction, and the Y component is the\n#                                     cross product of the spin axis and the look direction.\n#                                     \n#                                     4.

Ultra-violet imaging is done with one filter only,\n#                                     designated here as filter number 0.  In addition, the peak wavelength\n#                                     in Angstroms is given for the selected filter.\n#                                     \n#                                     7.

When the display orientation conventions in the variable 3\n#                                     description are applied, the low resolution camera image is rotated so\n#                                     that both Earth camera and low resolution camera images are displayed\n#                                     with Y axis pointing up and Z axis pointing toward the right.\n#                                     \n#                                     To obtain the coordinates of the observed position of a pixel,\n#                                     calculate the intersection of the line-of-sight with the surface\n#                                     of an oblately spheroidal Earth at the altitude given as\n#                                     variable 7.

Image counts\n#                                     Image pixel counts range from 0 to 255.  They are stored in a two-\n#                                     dimensional 256 x 256 byte array.  Images from the Earth camera\n#                                     (sensor 0) are conventionally displayed with row 1 at the top, row 256\n#                                     at the bottom, column 1 on the left, and column 256 on the right.  The\n#                                     conventional image display for the low resolution camera (sensor 1) is\n#                                     rotated 180 degrees so that the row 1-column 1 pixel is at the lower\n#                                     right corner and the row 256-column 256 pixel is at the upper left\n#                                     corner.  When displayed in this manner, the spacecraft spin axis is\n#                                     oriented to the right in the display, the X component is defined as\n#                                     the center of the image look direction, and the Y component is the\n#                                     cross product of the spin axis and the look direction.\n#                                     \n#                                     4.

Ultra-violet imaging is done with one filter only,\n#                                     designated here as filter number 0.  In addition, the peak wavelength\n#                                     in Angstroms is given for the selected filter.\n#                                     \n#                                     7.

When the display orientation conventions in the variable 3\n#                                     description are applied, the low resolution camera image is rotated so\n#                                     that both Earth camera and low resolution camera images are displayed\n#                                     with Y axis pointing up and Z axis pointing toward the right.\n#                                     \n#                                     To obtain the coordinates of the observed position of a pixel,\n#                                     calculate the intersection of the line-of-sight with the surface\n#                                     of an oblately spheroidal Earth at the altitude given as\n#                                     variable 7.

Image counts\n#                                     Image pixel counts range from 0 to 255.  They are stored in a two-\n#                                     dimensional 256 x 256 byte array.  Images from the Earth camera\n#                                     (sensor 0) are conventionally displayed with row 1 at the top, row 256\n#                                     at the bottom, column 1 on the left, and column 256 on the right.  The\n#                                     conventional image display for the low resolution camera (sensor 1) is\n#                                     rotated 180 degrees so that the row 1-column 1 pixel is at the lower\n#                                     right corner and the row 256-column 256 pixel is at the upper left\n#                                     corner.  When displayed in this manner, the spacecraft spin axis is\n#                                     oriented to the right in the display, the X component is defined as\n#                                     the center of the image look direction, and the Y component is the\n#                                     cross product of the spin axis and the look direction.\n#                                     \n#                                     4.

Ultra-violet imaging is done with one filter only,\n#                                     designated here as filter number 0.  In addition, the peak wavelength\n#                                     in Angstroms is given for the selected filter.\n#                                     \n#                                     7.

When the display orientation conventions in the variable 3\n#                                     description are applied, the low resolution camera image is rotated so\n#                                     that both Earth camera and low resolution camera images are displayed\n#                                     with Y axis pointing up and Z axis pointing toward the right.\n#                                     \n#                                     To obtain the coordinates of the observed position of a pixel,\n#                                     calculate the intersection of the line-of-sight with the surface\n#                                     of an oblately spheroidal Earth at the altitude given as\n#                                     variable 7.

Select\n#                                     the solution point closer to the spacecraft.\n#                                     \n#                                     19.

Image counts\n#                                     Image pixel counts range from 0 to 255.  They are stored in a two-\n#                                     dimensional 256 x 256 byte array.  Images from the Earth camera\n#                                     (sensor 0) are conventionally displayed with row 1 at the top, row 256\n#                                     at the bottom, column 1 on the left, and column 256 on the right.  The\n#                                     conventional image display for the low resolution camera (sensor 1) is\n#                                     rotated 180 degrees so that the row 1-column 1 pixel is at the lower\n#                                     right corner and the row 256-column 256 pixel is at the upper left\n#                                     corner.  When displayed in this manner, the spacecraft spin axis is\n#                                     oriented to the right in the display, the X component is defined as\n#                                     the center of the image look direction, and the Y component is the\n#                                     cross product of the spin axis and the look direction.\n#                                     \n#                                     4.

Ultra-violet imaging is done with one filter only,\n#                                     designated here as filter number 0.  In addition, the peak wavelength\n#                                     in Angstroms is given for the selected filter.\n#                                     \n#                                     7.

When the display orientation conventions in the variable 3\n#                                     description are applied, the low resolution camera image is rotated so\n#                                     that both Earth camera and low resolution camera images are displayed\n#                                     with Y axis pointing up and Z axis pointing toward the right.\n#                                     \n#                                     To obtain the coordinates of the observed position of a pixel,\n#                                     calculate the intersection of the line-of-sight with the surface\n#                                     of an oblately spheroidal Earth at the altitude given as\n#                                     variable 7.

Select\n#                                     the solution point closer to the spacecraft.\n#                                     \n#                                     19.

Image counts\n#                                     Image pixel counts range from 0 to 255.  They are stored in a two-\n#                                     dimensional 256 x 256 byte array.  Images from the Earth camera\n#                                     (sensor 0) are conventionally displayed with row 1 at the top, row 256\n#                                     at the bottom, column 1 on the left, and column 256 on the right.  The\n#                                     conventional image display for the low resolution camera (sensor 1) is\n#                                     rotated 180 degrees so that the row 1-column 1 pixel is at the lower\n#                                     right corner and the row 256-column 256 pixel is at the upper left\n#                                     corner.  When displayed in this manner, the spacecraft spin axis is\n#                                     oriented to the right in the display, the X component is defined as\n#                                     the center of the image look direction, and the Y component is the\n#                                     cross product of the spin axis and the look direction.\n#                                     \n#                                     4.

Ultra-violet imaging is done with one filter only,\n#                                     designated here as filter number 0.  In addition, the peak wavelength\n#                                     in Angstroms is given for the selected filter.\n#                                     \n#                                     7.

When the display orientation conventions in the variable 3\n#                                     description are applied, the low resolution camera image is rotated so\n#                                     that both Earth camera and low resolution camera images are displayed\n#                                     with Y axis pointing up and Z axis pointing toward the right.\n#                                     \n#                                     To obtain the coordinates of the observed position of a pixel,\n#                                     calculate the intersection of the line-of-sight with the surface\n#                                     of an oblately spheroidal Earth at the altitude given as\n#                                     variable 7.

Image counts\n#                                     Image pixel counts range from 0 to 255.  They are stored in a two-\n#                                     dimensional 256 x 256 byte array.  Images from the Earth camera\n#                                     (sensor 0) are conventionally displayed with row 1 at the top, row 256\n#                                     at the bottom, column 1 on the left, and column 256 on the right.  The\n#                                     conventional image display for the low resolution camera (sensor 1) is\n#                                     rotated 180 degrees so that the row 1-column 1 pixel is at the lower\n#                                     right corner and the row 256-column 256 pixel is at the upper left\n#                                     corner.  When displayed in this manner, the spacecraft spin axis is\n#                                     oriented to the right in the display, the X component is defined as\n#                                     the center of the image look direction, and the Y component is the\n#                                     cross product of the spin axis and the look direction.\n#                                     \n#                                     4.

Ultra-violet imaging is done with one filter only,\n#                                     designated here as filter number 0.  In addition, the peak wavelength\n#                                     in Angstroms is given for the selected filter.\n#                                     \n#                                     7.

When the display orientation conventions in the variable 3\n#                                     description are applied, the low resolution camera image is rotated so\n#                                     that both Earth camera and low resolution camera images are displayed\n#                                     with Y axis pointing up and Z axis pointing toward the right.\n#                                     \n#                                     To obtain the coordinates of the observed position of a pixel,\n#                                     calculate the intersection of the line-of-sight with the surface\n#                                     of an oblately spheroidal Earth at the altitude given as\n#                                     variable 7.

Image counts\n#                                     Image pixel counts range from 0 to 255.  They are stored in a two-\n#                                     dimensional 256 x 256 byte array.  Images from the Earth camera\n#                                     (sensor 0) are conventionally displayed with row 1 at the top, row 256\n#                                     at the bottom, column 1 on the left, and column 256 on the right.  The\n#                                     conventional image display for the low resolution camera (sensor 1) is\n#                                     rotated 180 degrees so that the row 1-column 1 pixel is at the lower\n#                                     right corner and the row 256-column 256 pixel is at the upper left\n#                                     corner.  When displayed in this manner, the spacecraft spin axis is\n#                                     oriented to the right in the display, the X component is defined as\n#                                     the center of the image look direction, and the Y component is the\n#                                     cross product of the spin axis and the look direction.\n#                                     \n#                                     4.

Ultra-violet imaging is done with one filter only,\n#                                     designated here as filter number 0.  In addition, the peak wavelength\n#                                     in Angstroms is given for the selected filter.\n#                                     \n#                                     7.

When the display orientation conventions in the variable 3\n#                                     description are applied, the low resolution camera image is rotated so\n#                                     that both Earth camera and low resolution camera images are displayed\n#                                     with Y axis pointing up and Z axis pointing toward the right.\n#                                     \n#                                     To obtain the coordinates of the observed position of a pixel,\n#                                     calculate the intersection of the line-of-sight with the surface\n#                                     of an oblately spheroidal Earth at the altitude given as\n#                                     variable 7.

Select\n#                                     the solution point closer to the spacecraft.\n#                                     \n#                                     19.

Image counts\n#                                     Image pixel counts range from 0 to 255.  They are stored in a two-\n#                                     dimensional 256 x 256 byte array.  Images from the Earth camera\n#                                     (sensor 0) are conventionally displayed with row 1 at the top, row 256\n#                                     at the bottom, column 1 on the left, and column 256 on the right.  The\n#                                     conventional image display for the low resolution camera (sensor 1) is\n#                                     rotated 180 degrees so that the row 1-column 1 pixel is at the lower\n#                                     right corner and the row 256-column 256 pixel is at the upper left\n#                                     corner.  When displayed in this manner, the spacecraft spin axis is\n#                                     oriented to the right in the display, the X component is defined as\n#                                     the center of the image look direction, and the Y component is the\n#                                     cross product of the spin axis and the look direction.\n#                                     \n#                                     4.

Ultra-violet imaging is done with one filter only,\n#                                     designated here as filter number 0.  In addition, the peak wavelength\n#                                     in Angstroms is given for the selected filter.\n#                                     \n#                                     7.

When the display orientation conventions in the variable 3\n#                                     description are applied, the low resolution camera image is rotated so\n#                                     that both Earth camera and low resolution camera images are displayed\n#                                     with Y axis pointing up and Z axis pointing toward the right.\n#                                     \n#                                     To obtain the coordinates of the observed position of a pixel,\n#                                     calculate the intersection of the line-of-sight with the surface\n#                                     of an oblately spheroidal Earth at the altitude given as\n#                                     variable 7.

Select\n#                                     the solution point closer to the spacecraft.\n#                                     \n#                                     19.

Image counts\n#                                     Image pixel counts range from 0 to 255.  They are stored in a two-\n#                                     dimensional 256 x 256 byte array.  Images from the Earth camera\n#                                     (sensor 0) are conventionally displayed with row 1 at the top, row 256\n#                                     at the bottom, column 1 on the left, and column 256 on the right.  The\n#                                     conventional image display for the low resolution camera (sensor 1) is\n#                                     rotated 180 degrees so that the row 1-column 1 pixel is at the lower\n#                                     right corner and the row 256-column 256 pixel is at the upper left\n#                                     corner.  When displayed in this manner, the spacecraft spin axis is\n#                                     oriented to the right in the display, the X component is defined as\n#                                     the center of the image look direction, and the Y component is the\n#                                     cross product of the spin axis and the look direction.\n#                                     \n#                                     4.

Ultra-violet imaging is done with one filter only,\n#                                     designated here as filter number 0.  In addition, the peak wavelength\n#                                     in Angstroms is given for the selected filter.\n#                                     \n#                                     7.

When the display orientation conventions in the variable 3\n#                                     description are applied, the low resolution camera image is rotated so\n#                                     that both Earth camera and low resolution camera images are displayed\n#                                     with Y axis pointing up and Z axis pointing toward the right.\n#                                     \n#                                     To obtain the coordinates of the observed position of a pixel,\n#                                     calculate the intersection of the line-of-sight with the surface\n#                                     of an oblately spheroidal Earth at the altitude given as\n#                                     variable 7.

Select\n#                                     the solution point closer to the spacecraft.\n#                                     \n#                                     19.

Image counts\n#                                     Image pixel counts range from 0 to 255.  They are stored in a two-\n#                                     dimensional 256 x 256 byte array.  Images from the Earth camera\n#                                     (sensor 0) are conventionally displayed with row 1 at the top, row 256\n#                                     at the bottom, column 1 on the left, and column 256 on the right.  The\n#                                     conventional image display for the low resolution camera (sensor 1) is\n#                                     rotated 180 degrees so that the row 1-column 1 pixel is at the lower\n#                                     right corner and the row 256-column 256 pixel is at the upper left\n#                                     corner.  When displayed in this manner, the spacecraft spin axis is\n#                                     oriented to the right in the display, the X component is defined as\n#                                     the center of the image look direction, and the Y component is the\n#                                     cross product of the spin axis and the look direction.\n#                                     \n#                                     4.

Ultra-violet imaging is done with one filter only,\n#                                     designated here as filter number 0.  In addition, the peak wavelength\n#                                     in Angstroms is given for the selected filter.\n#                                     \n#                                     7.

When the display orientation conventions in the variable 3\n#                                     description are applied, the low resolution camera image is rotated so\n#                                     that both Earth camera and low resolution camera images are displayed\n#                                     with Y axis pointing up and Z axis pointing toward the right.\n#                                     \n#                                     To obtain the coordinates of the observed position of a pixel,\n#                                     calculate the intersection of the line-of-sight with the surface\n#                                     of an oblately spheroidal Earth at the altitude given as\n#                                     variable 7.

Image counts\n#                                     Image pixel counts range from 0 to 255.  They are stored in a two-\n#                                     dimensional 256 x 256 byte array.  Images from the Earth camera\n#                                     (sensor 0) are conventionally displayed with row 1 at the top, row 256\n#                                     at the bottom, column 1 on the left, and column 256 on the right.  The\n#                                     conventional image display for the low resolution camera (sensor 1) is\n#                                     rotated 180 degrees so that the row 1-column 1 pixel is at the lower\n#                                     right corner and the row 256-column 256 pixel is at the upper left\n#                                     corner.  When displayed in this manner, the spacecraft spin axis is\n#                                     oriented to the right in the display, the X component is defined as\n#                                     the center of the image look direction, and the Y component is the\n#                                     cross product of the spin axis and the look direction.\n#                                     \n#                                     4.

Ultra-violet imaging is done with one filter only,\n#                                     designated here as filter number 0.  In addition, the peak wavelength\n#                                     in Angstroms is given for the selected filter.\n#                                     \n#                                     7.

When the display orientation conventions in the variable 3\n#                                     description are applied, the low resolution camera image is rotated so\n#                                     that both Earth camera and low resolution camera images are displayed\n#                                     with Y axis pointing up and Z axis pointing toward the right.\n#                                     \n#                                     To obtain the coordinates of the observed position of a pixel,\n#                                     calculate the intersection of the line-of-sight with the surface\n#                                     of an oblately spheroidal Earth at the altitude given as\n#                                     variable 7.

Image counts\n#                                     Image pixel counts range from 0 to 255.  They are stored in a two-\n#                                     dimensional 256 x 256 byte array.  Images from the Earth camera\n#                                     (sensor 0) are conventionally displayed with row 1 at the top, row 256\n#                                     at the bottom, column 1 on the left, and column 256 on the right.  The\n#                                     conventional image display for the low resolution camera (sensor 1) is\n#                                     rotated 180 degrees so that the row 1-column 1 pixel is at the lower\n#                                     right corner and the row 256-column 256 pixel is at the upper left\n#                                     corner.  When displayed in this manner, the spacecraft spin axis is\n#                                     oriented to the right in the display, the X component is defined as\n#                                     the center of the image look direction, and the Y component is the\n#                                     cross product of the spin axis and the look direction.\n#                                     \n#                                     4.

Ultra-violet imaging is done with one filter only,\n#                                     designated here as filter number 0.  In addition, the peak wavelength\n#                                     in Angstroms is given for the selected filter.\n#                                     \n#                                     7.
