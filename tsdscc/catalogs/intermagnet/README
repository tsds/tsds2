Create catalog_PT1{M,S}.txt, containing list of
available stations and start/stop times of data for station.
Note that catalog.js assumes earliest available data is in 1999.
 
 make catalogs 
or
 make catalog CADENCE=PT1M 
 make catalog CADENCE=PT1S 

Mirror all station data from stations listed in catalog_PT1{M,S}.txt

After full mirror, delete datacache cache.

TODO: Modify mirror to update after date on last file found.
