# Usage:
#  	make updates   # to update list of available files, download new files, and update and TSML
# 	make metadatas # to update TSML (if only metadata.js is changed)
#       make catalogs  # to update list of available files
#
# TODO:
#       Need to try mirror several times - sometimes files that are said to exist in metadata are not 
#       successfully downloaded first time. Find out why.
#
# Notes:
# 	This catalog must be mirrored because API creates a temporary file
# 	that is based on the timestamp (down to the second) of the request.
# 	If two requests are made in the same second, the first temporary
# 	file is over-written on their server.  Note: FTP access is
# 	available, obviating scraping (mirror.js):
# 	http://intermagnet.org/data-donnee/data-eng.php#conditions Request
# 	for FTP access sent on 9/27/2014.
#
# 	This does variation data only. Options:
# 	variation: vmin.min
# 	provisional: pmin.min
# 	quasi-definitive: qmin.min
# 	definitive: dmin.min
#
# 	metadata.js reads catalog_CADENCE.txt (created by catalog.js) to get list of stations.
# 	metadata.js writes node in XML for station if data file for that station is found.  The start/stop
#       date are derived from files found on disk.

Create catalog_PT1{M,S}.txt, containing list of
available stations and start/stop times of data for station.
Note that catalog.js assumes earliest available data is in 1999.
 
 make catalogs 
or
 make catalog CADENCE=PT1M 
 make catalog CADENCE=PT1S 

Mirror all station data from stations listed in catalog_PT1{M,S}.txt

 make mirrors
or
 make mirror CADENCE=PT1M
 make mirror CADENCE=PT1S

After full mirror, delete datacache cache.
