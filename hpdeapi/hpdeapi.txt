All,

Our requirements for the non-ASCII option for data output from and HPDE API are

(1) Easy for person creating a server to create the stream
(2) Easy to read in a script
(3) Fast
(4) A certain amount of flexibility
(5) Streamable (rules out CDF and OpenDAP)

Some of the things that I have read include
* http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/283635/data-format-for-
binary-data-transfer
* http://bjson.org/
* http://bsonspec.org/
* http://ubjson.org/
* https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/flatbuffers_benchmarks.html
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_data_serialization_formats
* http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/v4.3/netcdf-java/stream/
NcStream.html

All of the above tell me that there is nothing that satisfies (1) and (2).  To prove this to yourself,
(a) try reading any of the binary formats into MATLAB/IDL/Python and imagine the maintenance that would be required as users upgrade versions or as new library versions are created.
(b) or try to write a program that converts an ASCII table to any of the suggested formats.


Suppose that we have a file containing columns of
Time, instrumentID, Bx, By, Bz, Px, Py, Pz
e.g.,
2015-01-01T00:00:00.000000, A, 9.0, 10.0, 11.0, 5.0, 10.0, 11.0
2015-01-01T00:00:00.000000, B, 9.0, 10.0, 11.0, 5.0, 10.0, 11.0

where Px, Py, and Pz are the powers in a frequency bin centered on 3.0 Hz.  The following information
would be needed in the ASCII header:

binValue    null    null            null    null    null    3.0     3.0     3.0
binUnits    null    null            null    null    null    Hz      Hz      Hz
units       null    null            nT      nT      nT      nT      nT      nT
labels      Time    instrumentID    Bx      By      Bz      Px      Py      Pz

To create a binary version of this, we would need one bit of additional information:

columnTypes char32  char1           double  double  double  double  double  double
binValue    null    null            null    null    null    3.0     3.0     3.0
binUnits    null    null            null    null    null    Hz      Hz      Hz
units       null    null            nT      nT      nT      nT      nT      nT
labels      Time    instrumentID    Bx      By      Bz      Px      Py      Pz
