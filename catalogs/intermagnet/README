mirror.js makes one request for one day of data from one magnetometer.

It does this in serial mode because the API creates a temporary file that
is based on the timestamp (down to the second) of the request.  If two requests
are made in the same second, the first temporary file is over-written on their server.
(Not sure what will happen if someone else made a simultaneous request)
