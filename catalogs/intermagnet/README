After full mirror, delete datacache cache.

TODO: Modify mirror to update after date on last file found.
 
This catalog must be mirrored because API creates a temporary file that
is based on the timestamp (down to the second) of the request.  If two requests
are made in the same second, the first temporary file is over-written on their server.
(Not sure what will happen if someone else made a simultaneous request)
